# MAINTENANCE POLICY

I'm following the Semantic Versioning for its releases: (Major).(Minor).(Patch).

* Major version: Whenever there is something significant or any backwards
   incompatible changes.
* Minor version: When new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced a
   minor feature is introduced, or when a set of smaller features is rolled out.
* Patch number: When backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced that fix
   incorrect behavior.
* The current stable release will receive security patches and bug fixes
   (eg. 5.0 -> 5.0.1).
* Feature releases will mark the next supported stable release where the minor
   version is increased numerically by increments of one (eg. 5.0 -> 5.1).

I encourage everyone to run the latest stable release to ensure that you can
easily upgrade to the most secure and feature rich experience. In order to
make sure you can easily run the most recent stable release, we are working
hard to keep the update process simple and reliable.
